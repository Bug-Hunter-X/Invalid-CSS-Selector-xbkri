This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes tricky CSS bug related to invalid or unsupported selectors. The bug.css file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.css offers the corrected version.  The issue arises from using a selector that either has a syntax error or isn't understood by certain browsers, leading to unexpected rendering behavior. The solution involves carefully reviewing the selector and ensuring it adheres to valid CSS syntax and browser compatibility.
